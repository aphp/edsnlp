	abstract = {There is an urgent need to monitor the mental health of large populations, especially during crises such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic, to timely identify the most at-risk subgroups and to design targeted prevention campaigns. We therefore developed and validated surveillance indicators related to suicidality: the monthly number of hospitalisations caused by suicide attempts and the prevalence among them of five known risks factors. They were automatically computed analysing the electronic health records of fifteen university hospitals of the Paris area, France, using natural language processing algorithms based on artificial intelligence. We evaluated the relevance of these indicators conducting a retrospective cohort study. Considering 2,911,920 records contained in a common data warehouse, we tested for changes after the pandemic outbreak in the slope of the monthly number of suicide attempts by conducting an interrupted time-series analysis. We segmented the assessment time in two sub-periods: before (August 1, 2017, to February 29, 2020) and during (March 1, 2020, to June 31, 2022) the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We detected 14,023 hospitalisations caused by suicide attempts. Their monthly number accelerated after the {COVID}-19 outbreak with an estimated trend variation reaching 3.7 (95\%{CI} 2.1–5.3), mainly driven by an increase among girls aged 8–17 (trend variation 1.8, 95\%{CI} 1.2–2.5). After the pandemic outbreak, acts of domestic, physical and sexual violence were more often reported (prevalence ratios: 1.3, 95\%{CI} 1.16–1.48; 1.3, 95\%{CI} 1.10–1.64 and 1.7, 95\%{CI} 1.48–1.98), fewer patients died (p = 0.007) and stays were shorter (p {\textless} 0.001). Our study demonstrates that textual clinical data collected in multiple hospitals can be jointly analysed to compute timely indicators describing mental health conditions of populations. Our findings also highlight the need to better take into account the violence imposed on women, especially at early ages and in the aftermath of the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

    abstract = "{To develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that detects 18 conditions in French clinical notes, including 16 comorbidities of the Charlson index, while exploring a collaborative and privacy-enhancing workflow.The detection pipeline relied both on rule-based and machine learning algorithms, respectively, for named entity recognition and entity qualification, respectively. We used a large language model pre-trained on millions of clinical notes along with annotated clinical notes in the context of 3 cohort studies related to oncology, cardiology, and rheumatology. The overall workflow was conceived to foster collaboration between studies while respecting the privacy constraints of the data warehouse. We estimated the added values of the advanced technologies and of the collaborative setting.The pipeline reached macro-averaged F1-score positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.7 (95\\%CI 94.5-96.3), 95.4 (95\\%CI 94.0-96.3), 96.0 (95\\%CI 94.0-96.7), and 99.2 (95\\%CI 99.0-99.4), respectively. F1-scores were superior to those observed using alternative technologies or non-collaborative settings. The models were shared through a secured registry.We demonstrated that a community of investigators working on a common clinical data warehouse could efficiently and securely collaborate to develop, validate and use sensitive artificial intelligence models. In particular, we provided an efficient and robust NLP pipeline that detects conditions mentioned in clinical notes.}",
