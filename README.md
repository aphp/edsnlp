# EDS-NLP

EDS-NLP provides a set of spaCy components that are used to extract information from clinical notes written in French.

Check out the interactive [demo](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/demo/)!

If it's your first time with spaCy, we recommend you familiarise yourself with some of their key concepts by looking at the "[spaCy 101](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/tutorials/spacy101/)" page in the documentation.

## Quick start

### Installation

You can install EDS-NLP via `pip`:

```shell
pip install edsnlp
```

We recommend pinning the library version in your projects, or use a strict package manager like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```shell
pip install edsnlp==0.8.0
```

### A first pipeline

Once you've installed the library, let's begin with a very simple example that extracts mentions of COVID19 in a text, and detects whether they are negated.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.blank("fr")

terms = dict(
    covid=["covid", "coronavirus"],
)

# Sentencizer component, needed for negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.sentences")
# Matcher component
nlp.add_pipe("eds.matcher", config=dict(terms=terms))
# Negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.negation")

# Process your text in one call !
doc = nlp("Le patient est atteint de covid")

doc.ents
# Out: (covid,)

doc.ents[0]._.negation
# Out: False
```

## Documentation

## Disclaimer

The performances of an extraction pipeline may depend on the population and documents that are considered.
