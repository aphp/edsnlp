Fix explain mode, which was always triggered, in eds.history factory. Fix test in eds.sections . Previously, no check was done Remove SOFA scores spurious span suffixes v0.6.2 (2022-08-02) Added New SimstringMatcher matcher to perform fuzzy term matching, and algorithm parameter in terminology components and eds.matcher component Makefile to install,test the application and see the documentation Changed Add consultation date pattern \"CS\", and False Positive patterns for dates (namely phone numbers and pagination).

New as_ents parameter for eds.dates , to save detected dates as entities Changed Faster eds.sentences pipeline component with Cython Bump version of Pydantic in requirements.txt to 1.8.2 to handle an incompatibility with the ContextualMatcher Optimise space requirements by using .csv.gz compression for verbs Fixed eds.sentences behaviour with dot-delimited dates (eg 02.07.2022 , which counted as three sentences) v0.6.0 (2022-06-17) Added Complete revamp of the measurements detection pipeline, with better parsing and more exhaustive matching Add new functionality to the method Span._.date.to_datetime() to return a result infered from context for those cases with missing information. Force a batch size of 2000 when distributing a pipeline with Spark New patterns to pipeline eds.dates to identify cases where only the month is mentioned New eds.terminology component for generic terminology matching, using the kb_id_ attribute to store fine-grained entity label New eds.cim10 terminology matching pipeline New eds.drugs terminology pipeline that maps brand names and active ingredients to a unique ATC code v0.5.3 (2022-05-04) Added Support for strings in the example utility TNM detection and normalisation with the eds.TNM pipeline Support for arbitrary callback for Pandas multiprocessing, with the callback argument v0.5.2 (2022-04-29) Added Support for chained attributes in the processing pipelines Colour utility with the category20 colour palette Fixed Correct a REGEX on the date detector (both nov and nov. are now detected, as all other months) v0.5.1 (2022-04-11) Fixed Updated Numpy requirements to be compatible with the EDSPhraseMatcher v0.5.0 (2022-04-08) Added New eds language to better fit French clinical documents and improve speed Testing for markdown codeblocks to make sure the documentation is actually executable Changed Complete revamp of the date detection pipeline, with better parsing and more exhaustive matching Reimplementation of the EDSPhraseMatcher in Cython, leading to a x15 speed increase v0.4.4 Add measures pipeline Cap Jinja2 version to fix mkdocs Adding the possibility to add context in the processing module Improve the speed of char replacement pipelines (accents and quotes) Improve the speed of the regex matcher v0.4.3 Fix regex matching on spans.

Added eds.covid NER pipeline for detecting COVID19 mentions. v0.4.0 Profound re-write of the normalisation : The custom attribute CUSTOM_NORM is completely abandoned in favour of a more spacyfic alternative The normalizer pipeline modifies the NORM attribute in place Other pipelines can modify the Token._.excluded custom attribute EDS regex and term matchers can ignore excluded tokens during matching, effectively adding a second dimension to normalisation (choice of the attribute and possibility to skip pollution tokens regardless of the attribute) Matching can be performed on custom attributes more easily Qualifiers are regrouped together within the edsnlp.qualifiers submodule, the inheritance from the GenericMatcher is dropped. edsnlp.utils.filter.filter_spans now accepts a label_to_remove parameter. If set, only corresponding spans are removed, along with overlapping spans. Primary use-case: removing pseudo cues for qualifiers. Generalise the naming convention for extensions, which keep the same name as the pipeline that created them (eg Span._.negation for the eds.negation pipeline). The previous convention is kept for now, but calling it issues a warning. The dates pipeline underwent some light formatting to increase robustness and fix a few issues A new consultation_dates pipeline was added, which looks for dates preceded by expressions specific to consultation dates In rule-based processing, the terms.py submodule is replaced by patterns.py to reflect the possible presence of regular expressions Refactoring of the architecture : pipelines are now regrouped by type ( core , ner , misc , qualifiers ) matchers submodule contains RegexMatcher and PhraseMatcher classes, which interact with the normalisation multiprocessing submodule contains spark and local multiprocessing tools connectors contains Brat , OMOP and LabelTool connectors utils contains various utilities Add entry points to make pipeline usable directly, removing the need to import edsnlp.components . Add a eds namespace for components: for instance, negation becomes eds.negation . Using the former pipeline name still works, but issues a deprecation warning. Add 3 score pipelines related to emergency Add a helper function to use a spaCy pipeline as a Spark UDF. Fix alignment issues in RegexMatcher Change the alignment procedure, dropping clumsy numpy dependency in favour of bisect Change the name of eds.antecedents to eds.history . Calling eds.antecedents still works, but issues a deprecation warning and support will be removed in a future version. Add a eds.covid component, that identifies mentions of COVID Change the demo, to include NER components v0.3.2 Major revamp of the normalisation. The normalizer pipeline now adds atomic components ( lowercase , accents , quotes , pollution & endlines ) to the processing pipeline, and compiles the results into a new Doc._.normalized extension. The latter is itself a spaCy Doc object, wherein tokens are normalised and pollution tokens are removed altogether. Components that match on the CUSTOM_NORM attribute process the normalized document, and matches are brought back to the original document using a token-wise mapping. Update the RegexMatcher to use the CUSTOM_NORM attribute Add an EDSPhraseMatcher , wrapping spaCy's PhraseMatcher to enable matching on CUSTOM_NORM . Update the matcher and advanced pipelines to enable matching on the CUSTOM_NORM attribute. Add an OMOP connector, to help go back and forth between OMOP-formatted pandas dataframes and spaCy documents. Add a reason pipeline, that extracts the reason for visit. Add an endlines pipeline, that classifies newline characters between spaces and actual ends of line. Add possibility to annotate within entities for qualifiers ( negation , hypothesis , etc), ie if the cue is within the entity. Disabled by default. v0.3.1 Update dates to remove miscellaneous bugs. Add isort pre-commit hook. Improve performance for negation , hypothesis , antecedents , family and rspeech by using spaCy's filter_spans and our consume_spans methods.

Proposing a merge request At the very least, your changes should : Be well-documented ; Pass every tests, and preferably implement its own ; Follow the style guide. Testing your code We use the Pytest test suite. The following command will run the test suite. Writing your own tests is encouraged ! python -m pytest Testing Cython code Make sure the package is installed in editable mode . Otherwise Pytest won't be able to find the Cython modules. Should your contribution propose a bug fix, we require the bug be thoroughly tested. Architecture of a pipeline Pipelines should follow the same pattern : edsnlp/pipelines/<pipeline> |-- <pipeline>.py # Defines the component logic |-- patterns.py # Defines matched patterns |-- factory.py # Declares the pipeline to spaCy Style Guide We use Black to reformat the code. While other formatter only enforce PEP8 compliance, Black also makes the code uniform. In short : Black reformats entire files in place. It is not configurable. Moreover, the CI/CD pipeline enforces a number of checks on the \"quality\" of the code. To wit, non black-formatted code will make the test pipeline fail. We use pre-commit to keep our codebase clean. Refer to the development install tutorial for tips on how to format your files automatically. Most modern editors propose extensions that will format files on save. Documentation Make sure to document your improvements, both within the code with comprehensive docstrings, as well as in the documentation itself if need be. We use MkDocs for EDS-NLP's documentation. You can checkout the changes you make with: # Install the requirements $ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt ---> 100% color:green Installation successful # Run the documentation $ mkdocs serve Go to localhost:8000 to see your changes.

Although such a filtering is feasible using a regular expression, it essentially requires modifying each of the regular expressions. The ContextualMatcher allows to perform this extraction in a clear and concise way. The configuration file The whole ContextualMatcher pipeline is basically defined as a list of pattern dictionaries . Let us see step by step how to build such a list using the example stated just above. a. Finding mentions of cancer To do this, we can build either a set of terms or a set of regex . terms will be used to search for exact matches in the text. While less flexible, it is faster than using regex. In our case we could use the following lists (which are of course absolutely not exhaustives): terms = [ \"cancer\" , \"tumeur\" , ] regex = [ \"adeno(carcinom|[\\s-]?k)\" , \"neoplas\" , \"melanom\" , ] Maybe we want to exclude mentions of benign cancers: benign = \"benign|benin\" b. Find mention of a stage and extract its value For this we will forge a RegEx with one capturing group (basically a pattern enclosed in parentheses): stage = \"stade (I{1,3}V?|[1234])\" This will extract stage between 1 and 4 We can add a second regex to try to capture if the cancer is in a metastasis stage or not: metastase = \"(metasta)\" c. The complete configuration We can now put everything together: cancer = dict ( source = \"Cancer solide\" , regex = regex , terms = terms , regex_attr = \"NORM\" , exclude = dict ( regex = benign , window = 3 , ), assign = [ dict ( name = \"stage\" , regex = stage , window = ( - 10 , 10 ), replace_entity = True , reduce_mode = None , ), dict ( name = \"metastase\" , regex = metastase , window = 10 , replace_entity = False , reduce_mode = \"keep_last\" , ), ] ) Here the configuration consists of a single dictionary. We might want to also include lymphoma in the matcher: lymphome = dict ( source = \"Lymphome\" , regex = [ \"lymphom\" , \"lymphangio\" ], regex_attr = \"NORM\" , exclude = dict ( regex = [ \"hodgkin\" ], # (1) window = 3 , ), ) We are excluding \"Lymphome de Hodgkin\" here In this case, the configuration can be concatenated in a list: patterns = [ cancer , lymphome ] Available parameters for more flexibility 3 main parameters can be used to refine how entities will be formed The include_assigned parameter Following the previous example, you might want your extracted entities to include , if found, the cancer stage and the metastasis status. This can be achieved by setting include_assigned=True in the pipe configuration. For instance, from the sentence \"Le patient a un cancer au stade 3\", the extracted entity will be: \"cancer\" if include_assigned=False \"cancer au stade 3\" if include_assigned=True The reduce_mode parameter It may happen that an assignment matches more than once. For instance, in the (nonsensical) sentence \"Le patient a un cancer au stade 3 et au stade 4\", both \"stade 3\" and \"stade 4\" will be matched by the stage assign key. Depending on your use case, you may want to keep all the extractions, or just one. If reduce_mode=None (default), all extractions are kept in a list If reduce_mode=\"keep_first\" , only the extraction closest to the main matched entity will be kept (in this case, it would be \"stade 3\" since it is the closest to \"cancer\") If reduce_mode==\"keep_last\" , only the furthest extraction is kept. The replace_entity parameter This parameter can be se to True only for a single assign key per dictionary . This limitation comes from the purpose of this parameter: If set to True , the corresponding assign key will be returned as the entity, instead of the match itself. For clarity, let's take the same sentence \"Le patient a un cancer au stade 3\" as an example: if replace_entity=True in the stage assign key, then the extracted entity will be \"stade 3\" instead of \"cancer\" if replace_entity=False for every assign key, the returned entity will be, as expected, \"cancer\" Please notice that with replace_entity set to True, if the correponding assign key matches nothing, the entity will be discarded.

A single term or a list of terms (for exact matches) A dictionary (or list of dictionaries) to define exclusion rules. Exclusion rules are given as Regexes, and if a match is found in the surrounding context of an extraction, the extraction is removed. Each dictionary should have the following keys: window regex Size of the context to use (in number of words). You can provide the window as: A positive integer, in this case the used context will be taken after the extraction A negative integer, in this case the used context will be taken before the extraction A tuple of integers (start, end) , in this case the used context will be the snippet from start tokens before the extraction to end tokens after the extraction A single Regex or a list of Regexes. A dictionary to refine the extraction. Similarily to the exclude key, you can provide a dictionary to use on the context before and after the extraction. name window regex replace_entity reduce_mode A name (string) Size of the context to use (in number of words). You can provide the window as: A positive integer, in this case the used context will be taken after the extraction A negative integer, in this case the used context will be taken before the extraction A tuple of integers (start, end) , in this case the used context will be the snippet from start tokens before the extraction to end tokens after the extraction A dictionary where keys are labels and values are Regexes with a single capturing group If set to True , the match from the corresponding assign key will be used as entity, instead of the main match.

Utilities To simplify the use of the normalisation output, we provide the get_text utility function. It computes the textual representation for a Span or Doc object. Moreover, every span exposes a normalized_variant extension getter, which computes the normalised representation of an entity on the fly. Configuration Parameter Explanation Default accents Whether to strip accents True lowercase Whether to remove casing True quotes Whether to normalise quotes True pollution Whether to tag pollutions as excluded tokens True Pipelines Let's review each subcomponent. Lowercase The eds.lowercase pipeline transforms every token to lowercase. It is not configurable. Consider the following example : import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.utils import get_text config = dict ( lowercase = True , accents = False , quotes = False , pollution = False , ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" , config = config ) text = \"Pneumopathie \u00e0 NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus'\" doc = nlp ( text ) get_text ( doc , attr = \"NORM\" , ignore_excluded = False ) # Out: pneumopathie \u00e0 nbnbwbwbnbwbnbnbnbwbw 'coronavirus' Accents The eds.accents pipeline removes accents. To avoid edge cases, the component uses a specified list of accentuated characters and their unaccented representation, making it more predictable than using a library such as unidecode . Consider the following example : import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.utils import get_text config = dict ( lowercase = False , accents = True , quotes = False , pollution = False , ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" , config = config ) text = \"Pneumopathie \u00e0 NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus'\" doc = nlp ( text ) get_text ( doc , attr = \"NORM\" , ignore_excluded = False ) # Out: Pneumopathie a NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus' Apostrophes and quotation marks Apostrophes and quotation marks can be encoded using unpredictable special characters. The eds.quotes component transforms every such special character to ' and \" , respectively. Consider the following example : import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.utils import get_text config = dict ( lowercase = False , accents = False , quotes = True , pollution = False , ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" , config = config ) text = \"Pneumopathie \u00e0 NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus'\" doc = nlp ( text ) get_text ( doc , attr = \"NORM\" , ignore_excluded = False ) # Out: Pneumopathie \u00e0 NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW 'coronavirus' Pollution The pollution pipeline uses a set of regular expressions to detect pollutions (irrelevant non-medical text that hinders text processing). Corresponding tokens are marked as excluded (by setting Token._.excluded to True ), enabling the use of the phrase matcher. Consider the following example : import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.utils import get_text config = dict ( lowercase = False , accents = True , quotes = False , pollution = True , ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" , config = config ) text = \"Pneumopathie \u00e0 NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus'\" doc = nlp ( text ) get_text ( doc , attr = \"NORM\" , ignore_excluded = False ) # Out: Pneumopathie a NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW `coronavirus' get_text ( doc , attr = \"TEXT\" , ignore_excluded = True ) # Out: Pneumopathie \u00e0 `coronavirus' This example above shows that the normalisation scheme works on two axes: non-destructive text modification and exclusion of tokens. The two are independent: a matcher can use the NORM attribute but keep excluded tokens, and conversely, match on TEXT while ignoring excluded tokens. Types of pollution Pollution can come in various forms in clinical texts. We provide a small set of possible pollutions patterns that can be enabled or disabled as needed. For instance, if we consider biology tables as pollution, we only need to instantiate the normalizer pipe as follows: nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" , config = dict ( pollution = dict ( biology = True , ), ), ) Type Description Example Included by default information Footnote present in a lot of notes, providing information to the patient about the use of its data \"L'AP-HP collecte vos donn\u00e9es administratives \u00e0 des fins ...\" True bars Barcodes wrongly parsed as text \"...NBNbWbWbNbWbNBNbNbWbW...\" True biology Parsed biology results table. It often contains disease names that often leads to false positives with NER pipelines. \"...\u00a6UI/L \u00a620 \u00a6 \u00a6 \u00a620-70 Polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde Facteur rhumatoide \u00a6UI/mL \u00a6 \u00a6<10 \u00a6 \u00a6 \u00a6 \u00a60-14...\" False doctors List of doctor names and specialities, often found in left-side note margins.

Available pipelines Name Description eds.negation Detect negated entities eds.family Detect entities that pertain to a patient's kin rather than themself eds.hypothesis Detect entities subject to speculation eds.reported_speech Detect entities that are quoted from the patient eds.history Detect entities that pertain to the patient's history Rationale In a typical medical NLP pipeline, a group of clinicians would define a list of synonyms for a given concept of interest (say, for example, diabetes), and look for that terminology in a corpus of documents. Now, consider the following example: French English Le patient n'est pas diab\u00e9tique. Le patient est peut-\u00eatre diab\u00e9tique. Le p\u00e8re du patient est diab\u00e9tique. The patient is not diabetic. The patient could be diabetic. The patient's father is diabetic. There is an obvious problem: none of these examples should lead us to include this particular patient into the cohort. Warning We show an English example just to explain the issue. EDS-NLP remains a French-language medical NLP library. To curb this issue, EDS-NLP proposes rule-based pipelines that qualify entities to help the user make an informed decision about which patient should be included in a real-world data cohort. Under the hood Our qualifier pipelines all follow the same basic pattern: The pipeline extracts cues. We define three (possibly overlapping) kinds : preceding , ie cues that precede modulated entities ; following , ie cues that follow modulated entities ; in some cases, verbs , ie verbs that convey a modulation (treated as preceding cues). The pipeline splits the text between sentences and propositions, using annotations from a sentencizer pipeline and termination patterns, which define syntagma/proposition terminations. For each pre-extracted entity, the pipeline checks whether there is a cue between the start of the syntagma and the start of the entity, or a following cue between the end of the entity and the end of the proposition. Albeit simple, this algorithm can achieve very good performance depending on the modality. For instance, our eds.negation pipeline reaches 88% F1-score on our dataset. Dealing with pseudo-cues The pipeline can also detect pseudo-cues , ie phrases that contain cues but that are not cues themselves . For instance: sans doute / without doubt contains sans/without , but does not convey negation. Detecting pseudo-cues lets the pipeline filter out any cue that overlaps with a pseudo-cue. Sentence boundaries are required The rule-based algorithm detects cues, and propagate their modulation on the rest of the syntagma . For that reason, a qualifier pipeline needs a sentencizer component to be defined, and will fail otherwise.

This component may also use the output of the eds.sections pipeline . In that case, the entire ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent section is tagged as a medical history. Warning Be careful, the eds.sections component may oversize the ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents section. Indeed, it detects section titles and tags the entire text between a title and the next as a section. Hence, should a section title goes undetected after the ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents title, some parts of the document will erroneously be tagged as a medical history. To curb that possibility, using the output of the eds.sections component is deactivated by default.","title":"Medical History"},{"location":"pipelines/qualifiers/history/#usage","text":"The following snippet matches a simple terminology, and checks whether the extracted entities are history or not.

The other spaCy component SpanCategorizer only supports assigning to a specific span group and both components are not well suited for extracting entities with ill-defined boundaries (this can occur if your training data contains difficult and long entities). We propose the new eds.ner component to extract almost any named entity: flat entities like spaCy's EntityRecognizer overlapping entities overlapping entities of different labels (much like spaCy's SpanCategorizer ) entities will ill-defined boundaries However, the model cannot currently extract entities that are nested inside larger entities of the same label. The pipeline assigns both doc.ents (in which overlapping entities are filtered out) and doc.spans . Architecture The model performs token classification using the BIOUL (Begin, Inside, Outside, Unary, Last) tagging scheme. To extract overlapping entities, each label has its own tag sequence, so the model predicts $n_{labels}$ sequences of O, I, B, L, U tags. The architecture is displayed in the figure below. To enforce the tagging scheme, (ex: I cannot follow O but only B, ...), we use a stack of CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layers, one per label during both training and prediction.

The other spaCy component SpanCategorizer only supports assigning to a specific span group and both components are not well suited for extracting entities with ill-defined boundaries (this can occur if your training data contains difficult and long entities). We propose the new eds.ner component to extract almost any named entity: flat entities like spaCy's EntityRecognizer overlapping entities overlapping entities of different labels (much like spaCy's SpanCategorizer ) entities will ill-defined boundaries However, the model cannot currently extract entities that are nested inside larger entities of the same label.

To enforce the tagging scheme, (ex: I cannot follow O but only B, ...), we use a stack of CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layers, one per label during both training and prediction.

In this tutorial, we'll see how to use EDS-NLP to detect and normalise date mentions using eds.dates . This can have many applications, for dating medical events in particular. The eds.consultation_dates component, for instance, combines the date detection capabilities with a few simple patterns to detect the date of the consultation, when mentioned in clinical reports. Dates in clinical notes Consider the following example: French English Le patient est admis le 21 janvier pour une douleur dans le cou. Il se plaint d'une douleur chronique qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 il y a trois ans. The patient is admitted on January 21st for a neck pain. He complains about chronique pain that started three years ago. Clinical notes contain many different types of dates. To name a few examples: Type Description Examples Absolute Explicit date 2022-03-03 Partial Date missing the day, month or year le 3 janvier/on January 3rd , en 2021/in 2021 Relative Relative dates hier/yesterday , le mois dernier/last month Duration Durations pendant trois mois/for three months Warning We show an English example just to explain the issue. EDS-NLP remains a French-language medical NLP library. Extracting dates The followings snippet adds the eds.date component to the pipeline: import spacy nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.dates\" ) # (1) text = ( \"Le patient est admis le 21 janvier pour une douleur dans le cou. \\n \" \"Il se plaint d'une douleur chronique qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 il y a trois ans.\" ) # Detecting dates becomes trivial doc = nlp ( text ) # Likewise, accessing detected dates is hassle-free dates = doc . spans [ \"dates\" ] # (2) The date detection component is declared with eds.dates Dates are saved in the doc . spans [ \"dates\" ] key After this, accessing dates and there normalisation becomes trivial: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 dates # (1) # Out: [21 janvier, il y a trois ans] dates is a list of spaCy Span objects. Normalisation We can review each date and get its normalisation: date.text date._.date 21 janvier { \"day\" : 21 , \"month\" : 1 } il y a trois ans { \"direction\" : \"past\" , \"year\" : 3 } Dates detected by the pipeline component are parsed into a dictionary-like object. It includes every information that is actually contained in the text. To get a more usable representation, you may call the to_datetime() method. If there's enough information, the date will be represented in a datetime.datetime or datetime.timedelta object. If some information is missing, It will return None . Alternatively for this case, you can optionally set to True the parameter infer_from_context and you may also give a value for note_datetime . Date normalisation Since dates can be missing some information (eg en ao\u00fbt ), we refrain from outputting a datetime object in that case. Doing so would amount to guessing, and we made the choice of letting you decide how you want to handle missing dates. What next? The eds.dates pipeline component's role is merely to detect and normalise dates. It is the user's responsibility to use this information in a downstream application. For instance, you could use this pipeline to date medical entities. Let's do that. A medical event tagger Our pipeline will detect entities and events separately, and we will post-process the output Doc object to determine whether a given entity can be linked to a date. import spacy from datetime import datetime nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.sentences\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.dates\" ) config = dict ( regex = dict ( admission = [ \"admissions?\" , \"admise?\" , \"prise? en charge\" ]), attr = \"LOWER\" , ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = config ) text = ( \"Le patient est admis le 12 avril pour une douleur \" \"survenue il y a trois jours. \" \"Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en charge l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re. \" \"Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9 en mai 1995.\" ) doc = nlp ( text ) At this point, the document is ready to be post-processed: its ents and spans [ \"dates\" ] are populated: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 doc . ents # Out: (admis, pris en charge) doc . spans [ \"dates\" ] # Out: [12 avril, il y a trois jours, l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, mai 1995] note_datetime = datetime ( year = 1999 , month = 8 , day = 27 ) for i , date in enumerate ( doc . spans [ \"dates\" ]): print ( i , \" - \" , date , \" - \" , date . _ . date . to_datetime ( note_datetime = note_datetime , infer_from_context = False , tz = None ), ) # Out: 0 - 12 avril - None # Out: 1 - il y a trois jours - 1999-08-24 00:00:00 # Out: 2 - l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re - 1998-08-27 00:00:00 # Out: 3 - mai 1995 - None for i , date in enumerate ( doc . spans [ \"dates\" ]): print ( i , \" - \" , date , \" - \" , date . _ . date . to_datetime ( note_datetime = note_datetime , infer_from_context = True , tz = None , default_day = 15 , ), ) # Out: 0 - 12 avril - 1999-04-12T00:00:00 # Out: 1 - il y a trois jours - 1999-08-24 00:00:00 # Out: 2 - l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re - 1998-08-27 00:00:00 # Out: 3 - mai 1995 - 1995-05-15T00:00:00 As a first heuristic, let's consider that an entity can be linked to a date if the two are in the same sentence. In the case where multiple dates are present, we'll select the closest one. utils.py from spacy.tokens import Span from typing import List , Optional def candidate_dates ( ent : Span ) -> List [ Span ]: \"\"\"Return every dates in the same sentence as the entity\"\"\" return [ date for date in ent . doc . spans [ \"dates\" ] if date . sent == ent . sent ] def get_event_date ( ent : Span ) -> Optional [ Span ]: \"\"\"Link an entity to the closest date in the sentence, if any\"\"\" dates = candidate_dates ( ent ) # (1) if not dates : return dates = sorted ( dates , key = lambda d : min ( abs ( d . start - ent . end ), abs ( ent . start - d . end )), ) return dates [ 0 ] # (2) Get all dates present in the same sentence. Sort the dates, and keep the first item. We can apply this simple function: import spacy from utils import get_event_date nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.sentences\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.dates\" ) config = dict ( regex = dict ( admission = [ \"admissions?\" , \"admise?\" , \"prise? en charge\" ]), attr = \"LOWER\" , ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = config ) text = ( \"Le patient est admis le 12 avril pour une douleur \" \"survenue il y a trois jours. \" \"Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en charge l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re.\" ) doc = nlp ( text ) for ent in doc . ents : date = get_event_date ( ent ) print ( f \" { ent . text : <20 }{ date . text : <20 }{ date . _ . date . to_datetime () } \" ) # Out: admis 12 avril 2020 2020-04-12T00:00:00+02:00 # Out: pris en charge l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re -1 year Which will output: ent get_event_date(ent) get_event_date(ent)._.date.to_datetime() admis 12 avril 2020-04-12T00:00:00+02:00 pris en charge l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re -1 year","title":"Detecting dates"},{"location":"tutorials/detecting-dates/#detecting-dates","text":"We now know how to match a terminology and qualify detected entities, which covers most use cases for a typical medical NLP project.

In this tutorial, we will cover : Matching a terminology using spaCy's matchers, as well as RegExps Matching on a specific attribute You should consider reading the matcher's specific documentation for a description. Comparison to spaCy's matcher spaCy's Matcher and PhraseMatcher use a very efficient algorithm that compare a hashed representation token by token. They are not components by themselves, but can underpin rule-based pipelines. EDS-NLP's RegexMatcher lets the user match entire expressions using regular expressions. To achieve this, the matcher has to get to the text representation, match on it, and get back to spaCy's abstraction. The EDSPhraseMatcher lets EDS-NLP reuse spaCy's efficient algorithm, while adding the ability to skip pollution tokens (see the normalisation documentation for detail) A simple use case : finding COVID19 Let's try to find mentions of COVID19 and references to patients within a clinical note. import spacy text = ( \"Motif de prise en charge : probable pneumopathie a COVID19, \" \"sans difficult\u00e9s respiratoires \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est asthmatique.\" ) terms = dict ( covid = [ \"coronavirus\" , \"covid19\" ], respiratoire = [ \"asthmatique\" , \"respiratoire\" ], ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = dict ( terms = terms )) doc = nlp ( text ) doc . ents # Out: (asthmatique,) Let's unpack what happened: We defined a dictionary of terms to look for, in the form {'label': list of terms} .

This example showcases a limitation of our term dictionary : the phrases COVID19 and difficult\u00e9s respiratoires were not detected by the pipeline. To increase recall, we could just add every possible variation : terms = dict( - covid=[\"coronavirus\", \"covid19\"], + covid=[\"coronavirus\", \"covid19\", \"COVID19\"], - respiratoire=[\"asthmatique\", \"respiratoire\"], + respiratoire=[\"asthmatique\", \"respiratoire\", \"respiratoires\"], ) But what if we come across Coronavirus ? Surely we can do better! Matching on normalised text We can modify the matcher's configuration to match on other attributes instead of the verbatim input. You can refer to spaCy's list of available token attributes . Let's focus on two: The LOWER attribute, which lets you match on a lowercased version of the text. The NORM attribute, which adds some basic normalisation (eg \u0153 to oe ). EDS-NLP provides a eds.normalizer component that extends the level of cleaning on the NORM attribute. The LOWER attribute Matching on the lowercased version is extremely easy: import spacy text = ( \"Motif de prise en charge : probable pneumopathie a COVID19, \" \"sans difficult\u00e9s respiratoires \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est asthmatique.\" ) terms = dict ( covid = [ \"coronavirus\" , \"covid19\" ], respiratoire = [ \"asthmatique\" , \"respiratoire\" , \"respiratoires\" ], ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = dict ( terms = terms , attr = \"LOWER\" , # (1) ), ) doc = nlp ( text ) doc . ents # Out: (COVID19, respiratoires, asthmatique) The matcher's attr parameter defines the attribute that the matcher will use. It is set to \"TEXT\" by default (ie verbatim text). This code is complete, and should run as is. Using the normalisation component EDS-NLP provides its own normalisation component, which modifies the NORM attribute in place. It handles: removal of accentuated characters; normalisation of quotes and apostrophes; lowercasing, which enabled by default in spaCy \u2013 EDS-NLP lets you disable it; removal of pollution. Pollution in clinical texts EDS-NLP is meant to be deployed on clinical reports extracted from hospitals information systems. As such, it is often riddled with extraction issues or administrative artifacts that \"pollute\" the report. As a core principle, EDS-NLP never modifies the input text , and nlp ( text ) . text == text is always true . However, we can tag some tokens as pollution elements, and avoid using them for matching the terminology. You can activate it like any other component. import spacy text = ( \"Motif de prise en charge : probable pneumopathie a ===== COVID19, \" # (1) \"sans difficult\u00e9s respiratoires \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est asthmatique.\" ) terms = dict ( covid = [ \"coronavirus\" , \"covid19\" , \"pneumopathie \u00e0 covid19\" ], # (2) respiratoire = [ \"asthmatique\" , \"respiratoire\" , \"respiratoires\" ], ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) # Add the normalisation component nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" ) # (3) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = dict ( terms = terms , attr = \"NORM\" , # (4) ignore_excluded = True , # (5) ), ) doc = nlp ( text ) doc . ents # Out: (pneumopathie a ===== COVID19, respiratoires, asthmatique) We've modified the example to include a simple pollution.

The normalisation lives in the NORM attribute We can tell the matcher to ignore excluded tokens (tokens tagged as pollution by the normalisation component). This is not an obligation. Using the normalisation component, you can match on a normalised version of the text, as well as skip pollution tokens during the matching process . Using term matching with the normalisation If you use the term matcher with the normalisation, bear in mind that the examples go through the pipeline . That's how the matcher was able to recover pneumopathie a ===== COVID19 despite the fact that we used an accentuated \u00e0 in the terminology. The term matcher matches the input text to the provided terminology, using the selected attribute in both cases. The NORM attribute that corresponds to \u00e0 and a is the same: a . Preliminary conclusion We have matched all mentions! However, we had to spell out the singular and plural form of respiratoire ... And what if we wanted to detect covid 19 , or covid-19 ? Of course, we could write out every imaginable possibility, but this will quickly become tedious. Using regular expressions Let us redefine the pipeline once again, this time using regular expressions: import spacy text = ( \"Motif de prise en charge : probable pneumopathie a COVID19, \" \"sans difficult\u00e9s respiratoires \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est asthmatique.\" ) regex = dict ( covid = r \"(coronavirus|covid[-\\s]?19)\" , respiratoire = r \"respiratoires?\" , ) terms = dict ( respiratoire = \"asthmatique\" ) nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = dict ( regex = regex , # (1) terms = terms , # (2) attr = \"LOWER\" , # (3) ), ) doc = nlp ( text ) doc . ents # Out: (COVID19, respiratoires, asthmatique) We can now match using regular expressions. We can mix and match patterns! Here we keep looking for patients using spaCy's term matching. RegExp matching is not limited to the verbatim text! You can choose to use one of spaCy's native attribute, ignore excluded tokens, etc. This code is complete, and should run as is. Using regular expressions can help define richer patterns using more compact queries. Visualising matched entities EDS-NLP is part of the spaCy ecosystem, which means we can benefit from spaCy helper functions. For instance, spaCy's visualiser displacy can let us visualise the matched entities: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from spacy import displacy colors = { \"covid\" : \"orange\" , \"respiratoire\" : \"steelblue\" , } options = { \"colors\" : colors , } displacy . render ( doc , style = \"ent\" , options = options ) If you run this within a notebook, you should get: Motif de prise en charge : probable pneumopathie a COVID19 covid , sans difficult\u00e9s respiratoires respiratoire Le p\u00e8re du patient est asthmatique respiratoire .","title":"Matching a terminology"},{"location":"tutorials/matching-a-terminology/#matching-a-terminology","text":"Matching a terminology is perhaps the most basic application of a medical NLP pipeline.

Once the pipeline is tested and ready to be applied on an entire corpus, we'll want to deploy it efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll cover a few best practices and some caveats to avoid. Then, we'll explore methods that EDS-NLP provides to use a spaCy pipeline directly on a pandas or Spark DataFrame. These can drastically increase throughput. Consider this simple pipeline: Pipeline definition: pipeline.py import spacy nlp = spacy . blank ( \"fr\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.sentences\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" ) config = dict ( terms = dict ( patient = [ \"patient\" , \"malade\" ]), attr = \"NORM\" , ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.matcher\" , config = config ) # Add qualifiers nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.negation\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.hypothesis\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.family\" ) # Add date detection nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.dates\" ) Let's deploy it on a large number of documents. What about a for loop? Suppose we have a corpus of text: text = ( \"Patient admis le 25 septembre 2021 pour suspicion de Covid. \\n \" \"Pas de cas de coronavirus dans ce service. \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est atteint du covid.\" ) corpus = [ text ] * 10000 # (1) This is admittedly ugly. But you get the idea, we have a corpus of 10 000 documents we want to process... You could just apply the pipeline document by document. A naive approach # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 docs = [ nlp ( text ) for text in corpus ] It turns out spaCy has a powerful parallelisation engine for an efficient processing of multiple texts. So the first step for writing more efficient spaCy code is to use nlp.pipe when processing multiple texts: - docs = [nlp(text) for text in corpus] + docs = list(nlp.pipe(corpus)) The nlp.pipe method takes an iterable as input, and outputs a generator of Doc object. Under the hood, texts are processed in batches, which is often much more efficient. Batch processing and EDS-NLP For now, EDS-NLP does not natively parallelise its components, so the gain from using nlp.pipe will not be that significant. Nevertheless, it's good practice to avoid using for loops when possible. Moreover, you will benefit from the batched tokenisation step. The way EDS-NLP is used may depend on how many documents you are working with. Once working with tens of thousands of them, parallelising the processing can be really efficient (up to 20x faster), but will require a (tiny) bit more work. Here are shown 4 ways to analyse texts depending on your needs A wrapper is available to simply switch between those use cases. Processing a pandas DataFrame Processing text within a pandas DataFrame is a very common use case. In many applications, you'll select a corpus of documents over a distributed cluster, load it in memory and process all texts. The OMOP CDM In every tutorial that mentions distributing EDS-NLP over a corpus of documents, we will expect the data to be organised using a flavour of the OMOP Common Data Model . The OMOP CDM defines two tables of interest to us: the note table contains the clinical notes the note_nlp table holds the results of a NLP pipeline applied to the note table. To make sure we can follow along, we propose three recipes for getting the DataFrame: using a dummy dataset like before, loading a CSV or by loading a Spark DataFrame into memory. Dummy example Loading data from a CSV Loading data from a Spark DataFrame import pandas as pd text = ( \"Patient admis le 25 septembre 2021 pour suspicion de Covid. \\n \" \"Pas de cas de coronavirus dans ce service. \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est atteint du covid.\" ) corpus = [ text ] * 1000 data = pd . DataFrame ( dict ( note_text = corpus )) data [ \"note_id\" ] = range ( len ( data )) import pandas as pd data = pd . read_csv ( \"note.csv\" ) from pyspark.sql.session import SparkSession spark = SparkSession . builder . getOrCreate () df = spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM note\" ) df = df . select ( \"note_id\" , \"note_text\" ) data = df . limit ( 1000 ) . toPandas () # (1) We limit the size of the DataFrame to make sure we do not overwhelm our machine. We'll see in what follows how we can efficiently deploy our pipeline on the data object. \"By hand\" We can deploy the pipeline using nlp.pipe directly, but we'll need some work to format the results in a usable way. Let's see how this might go, before using EDS-NLP's helper function to avoid the boilerplate code. processing.py from spacy.tokens import Doc from typing import Any , Dict , List def get_entities ( doc : Doc ) -> List [ Dict [ str , Any ]]: \"\"\"Return a list of dict representation for the entities\"\"\" entities = [] for ent in doc . ents : d = dict ( start = ent . start_char , end = ent . end_char , label = ent . label_ , lexical_variant = ent . text , negation = ent . _ . negation , hypothesis = ent . _ . hypothesis , family = ent . _ . family , key = \"ents\" , ) entities . append ( d ) for date in doc . spans . get ( \"dates\" , []): d = dict ( start = date . start_char , end = date . end_char , label = date . _ . date , lexical_variant = date . text , key = \"dates\" , ) entities . append ( d ) return entities # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from processing import get_entities import pandas as pd data [ \"doc\" ] = list ( nlp . pipe ( data . note_text )) # (1) data [ \"entities\" ] = data . doc . apply ( get_entities ) # (2) # \"Explode\" the dataframe data = data [[ \"note_id\" , \"entities\" ]] . explode ( \"entities\" ) data = data . dropna () data = data . reset_index ( drop = True ) data = data [[ \"note_id\" ]] . join ( pd . json_normalize ( data . entities )) We use spaCy's efficient nlp.pipe method This part is far from optimal, since it uses apply... But the computationally heavy part is in the previous line, since get_entities merely reads pre-computed values from the document. The result on the first note: note_id start end label lexical_variant negation hypothesis family key 0 0 7 patient Patient 0 0 0 ents 0 114 121 patient patient 0 0 1 ents 0 17 34 2021-09-25 25 septembre 2021 nan nan nan dates Using EDS-NLP's helper functions Let's see how we can efficiently deploy our pipeline using EDS-NLP's utility methods. They share the same arguments: Argument Description Default note A DataFrame, with two required columns, note_id and note_id Required nlp The pipeline object Required context A list of column names to add context to the generate Doc [] additional_spans Keys in doc.spans to include besides doc.ents [] extensions Custom extensions to use [] results_extractor An arbitrary callback function that turns a Doc into a list of dictionaries None (use extensions) Adding context You might want to store some context information contained in the note DataFrame as an extension in the generated Doc object. For instance, you may use the eds.dates pipeline in coordination with the note_datetime field to normalise a relative date (eg Le patient est venu il y a trois jours/The patient came three days ago ). In this case, you can use the context parameter and provide a list of column names you want to add: note_nlp = single_pipe ( data , nlp , context = [ \"note_datetime\" ], additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = [ \"date.day\" , \"date.month\" , \"date.year\" ], ) In this example, the note_datetime field becomes available as doc._.note_datetime . Depending on your pipeline, you may want to extract other extensions. To do so, simply provide those extension names (without the leading underscore) to the extensions argument. This should cover most use-cases . In case you need more fine-grained control over how you want to process the results of your pipeline, you can provide an arbitrary results_extractor function. Said function is expected to take a spaCy Doc object as input, and return a list of dictionaries that will be used to construct the note_nlp table. For instance, the get_entities function defined earlier could be distributed directly: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing.simple import pipe as single_pipe from processing import get_entities note_nlp = single_pipe ( data , nlp , results_extractor = get_entities , ) A few caveats on using an arbitrary function Should you use multiprocessing, your arbitrary function needs to be serialisable as a pickle object in order to be distributed. That implies a few limitations on the way your function can be defined. Namely, your function needs to be discoverable (see the pickle documentation on the subject ). When deploying it should be defined such a way that can be accessed by the worker processes. For that reason, arbitrary functions can only be distributed via Spark/Koalas if their source code is advertised to the Spark workers . To that end, you should define your custom function in a pip-installed Python package. Single process EDS-NLP provides a single_pipe helper function that avoids the hassle we just went through in the previous section. Using it is trivial: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing.simple import pipe as single_pipe note_nlp = single_pipe ( data , nlp , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = [ \"date.day\" , \"date.month\" , \"date.year\" ], ) In just two Python statements, we get the exact same result as before! Multiple processes Depending on the size of your corpus, and if you have CPU cores to spare, you may want to distribute the computation. Again, EDS-NLP makes it extremely easy for you, through the parallel_pipe helper: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing.parallel import pipe as parallel_pipe note_nlp = parallel_pipe ( data , nlp , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = [ \"date.day\" , \"date.month\" , \"date.year\" ], n_jobs =- 2 , # (1) ) The n_jobs parameter controls the number of workers that you deploy in parallel. Negative inputs means \"all cores minus abs ( n_jobs + 1 ) \" Using a large number of workers and memory use In spaCy, even a rule-based pipeline is a memory intensive object. Be wary of using too many workers, lest you get a memory error. Depending on your machine, you should get a significant speed boost (we got 20x acceleration on a shared cluster using 62 cores). Deploying EDS-NLP on Spark/Koalas Should you need to deploy spaCy on a distributed DataFrame such as a Spark or a Koalas DataFrame, EDS-NLP has you covered. The procedure for those two types of DataFrame is virtually the same. Under the hood, EDS-NLP automatically deals with the necessary conversions. Suppose you have a Spark DataFrame: Using a dummy example Loading a pre-existing table Using a Koalas DataFrame from pyspark.sql.session import SparkSession from pyspark.sql import types as T spark = SparkSession . builder . getOrCreate () schema = T . StructType ( [ T . StructField ( \"note_id\" , T . IntegerType ()), T . StructField ( \"note_text\" , T . StringType ()), ] ) text = ( \"Patient admis le 25 septembre 2021 pour suspicion de Covid. \\n \" \"Pas de cas de coronavirus dans ce service. \\n \" \"Le p\u00e8re du patient est atteint du covid.\" ) data = [( i , text ) for i in range ( 1000 )] df = spark . createDataFrame ( data = data , schema = schema ) from pyspark.sql.session import SparkSession spark = SparkSession . builder . getOrCreate () df = spark . sql ( \"SELECT * FROM note\" ) df = df . select ( \"note_id\" , \"note_text\" ) from pyspark.sql.session import SparkSession import databricks.koalas spark = SparkSession . builder . getOrCreate () df = spark . sql ( \"SELECT note_id, note_text FROM note\" ) . to_koalas () Declaring types There is a minor twist, though: Spark (or Koalas) needs to know in advance the type of each extension you want to save. Thus, if you need additional extensions to be saved, you'll have to provide a dictionary to the extensions argument instead of a list of strings. This dictionary will have the name of the extension as keys and its PySpark type as value. Accepted types are the ones present in pyspark.sql.types . EDS-NLP provides a helper function, pyspark_type_finder , is available to get the correct type for most Python objects. You just need to provide an example of the type you wish to collect: int_type = pyspark_type_finder ( 1 ) # Out: IntegerType() Be careful when providing the example Do not blindly provide the first entity matched by your pipeline : it might be ill-suited. For instance, the Span._.date makes sense for a date span, but will be None if you use an entity... Deploying the pipeline Once again, using the helper is trivial: Spark Koalas # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing.distributed import pipe as distributed_pipe note_nlp = distributed_pipe ( df , nlp , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = { \"date.year\" : int_type , \"date.month\" : int_type , \"date.day\" : int_type }, ) # Check that the pipeline was correctly distributed: note_nlp . show ( 5 ) # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing.distributed import pipe as distributed_pipe note_nlp = distributed_pipe ( df , nlp , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = { \"date.year\" : int_type , \"date.month\" : int_type , \"date.day\" : int_type }, ) # Check that the pipeline was correctly distributed: note_nlp . head () Using Spark or Koalas, you can deploy EDS-NLP pipelines on tens of millions of documents with ease! One function to rule them all EDS-NLP provides a wrapper to simplify deployment even further: # \u2191 Omitted code above \u2191 from edsnlp.processing import pipe ### Small pandas DataFrame note_nlp = pipe ( note = df . limit ( 1000 ) . toPandas (), nlp = nlp , n_jobs = 1 , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = [ \"date.day\" , \"date.month\" , \"date.year\" ], ) ### Larger pandas DataFrame note_nlp = pipe ( note = df . limit ( 10000 ) . toPandas (), nlp = nlp , n_jobs =- 2 , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = [ \"date.day\" , \"date.month\" , \"date.year\" ], ) ### Huge Spark or Koalas DataFrame note_nlp = pipe ( note = df , nlp = nlp , how = \"spark\" , additional_spans = [ \"dates\" ], extensions = { \"date.year\" : int_type , \"date.month\" : int_type , \"date.day\" : int_type }, )","title":"Processing multiple texts"},{"location":"tutorials/multiple-texts/#processing-multiple-texts","text":"In the previous tutorials, we've seen how to apply a spaCy NLP pipeline to a single text.

EDSPhraseMatcher The EDSPhraseMatcher lets you efficiently match large terminology lists, by comparing tokenx against a given attribute. This matcher differs from the spacy.PhraseMatcher in that it allows to skip pollution tokens. To make it efficient, we have reimplemented the matching algorithm in Cython, like the original spacy.PhraseMatcher . You can use it as described in the code below. import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.phrase import EDSPhraseMatcher nlp = spacy . blank ( \"eds\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" ) doc = nlp ( \"On ne rel\u00e8ve pas de signe du Corona =============== virus.\" ) matcher = EDSPhraseMatcher ( nlp . vocab , attr = \"NORM\" ) matcher . build_patterns ( nlp , { \"covid\" : [ \"corona virus\" , \"coronavirus\" , \"covid\" ], \"diabete\" : [ \"diabete\" , \"diabetique\" ], }, ) list ( matcher ( doc , as_spans = True ))[ 0 ] . text # Out: Corona =============== virus RegexMatcher The RegexMatcher performs full-text regex matching. It is especially useful to handle spelling variations like mammo-?graphies? . Like the EDSPhraseMatcher , this class allows to skip pollution tokens. Note that this class is significantly slower than the EDSPhraseMatcher : if you can, try enumerating lexical variations of the target phrases and feed them to the PhraseMatcher instead. You can use it as described in the code below. import spacy from edsnlp.matchers.regex import RegexMatcher nlp = spacy . blank ( \"eds\" ) nlp . add_pipe ( \"eds.normalizer\" ) doc = nlp ( \"On ne rel\u00e8ve pas de signe du Corona =============== virus.\" ) matcher = RegexMatcher ( attr = \"NORM\" , ignore_excluded = True ) matcher . build_patterns ( { \"covid\" : [ \"corona[ ]*virus\" , \"covid\" ], \"diabete\" : [ \"diabete\" , \"diabetique\" ], }, ) list ( matcher ( doc , as_spans = True ))[ 0 ] . text # Out: Corona =============== virus SimstringMatcher The SimstringMatcher performs fuzzy term matching by comparing spans of text with a similarity metric. It is especially useful to handle spelling variations like paracetomol (instead of paracetamol ). The simstring algorithm compares two strings by enumerating their char trigrams and measuring the overlap between the two sets. In the previous example: - paracetomol becomes ##p #pa par ara rac ace cet eto tom omo mol ol# l## - paracetamol becomes ##p #pa par ara rac ace cet eta tam amo mol ol# l## and the Dice (or F1) similarity between the two sets is 0.75. Like the EDSPhraseMatcher , this class allows to skip pollution tokens.
