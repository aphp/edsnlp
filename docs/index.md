# Getting started

EDS-NLP provides a set of spaCy components that are used to extract information from clinical notes written in French.

If it's your first time with spaCy, we recommend you familiarise yourself with some of their key concepts by looking at the "[spaCy 101](tutorials/spacy101.md)" page.

## Quick start

### Installation

You can install EDS-NLP via `pip`:

<!-- termynal -->

```
$ pip install edsnlp
---> 100%
Installed
```

We recommend pinning the library version in your projects, or use a strict package manager like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```
pip install edsnlp==0.4.1
```

### A first pipeline

Once you've installed the library, let's begin with a very simple example that extracts mentions of COVID19 in a text, and detects whether they are negated.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.blank("fr")  # (1)

terms = dict(
    covid=["covid", "coronavirus"],  # (2)
)

# Sentencizer component, needed for negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.sentences")  # (3)
# Matcher component
nlp.add_pipe("eds.matcher", config=dict(terms=terms))  # (4)
# Negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.negation")

# Process your text in one call !
doc = nlp("Le patient est atteint de covid")

doc.ents  # (5)
# Out: (covid,)

doc.ents[0]._.negation  # (6)
# Out: False
```

1. We only need spaCy's French tokenizer.
1. This example terminology provides a very simple, and by no means exhaustive, list of synonyms for COVID19.
1. In spaCy, pipelines are added via the [`nlp.add_pipe` method](https://spacy.io/api/language#add_pipe). EDS-NLP pipelines are automatically discovered by spaCy.
1. See the [matching tutorial](tutorials/matching-a-terminology.md) for mode details.
1. spaCy stores extracted entities in the [`Doc.ents` attribute](https://spacy.io/api/doc#ents).
1. The [`eds.negation` pipeline](pipelines/qualifiers/negation.md) has added a `negation` custom attribute.

This example is complete, it should run as-is. Check out the [spaCy 101 page](tutorials/spacy101.md) if you're not familiar with spaCy.

## Disclaimer

The performances of an extraction pipeline may depend on the population and documents that are considered.
