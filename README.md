EDS-NLP
=======

EDS-NLP is a collaborative NLP framework that aims primarily at extracting information from French clinical notes.
At its core, it is a collection of components or pipes, either rule-based functions or
deep learning modules. These components are organized into a novel efficient and modular pipeline system, built for hybrid and multitask models. We use [spaCy](https://spacy.io) to represent documents and their annotations, and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) as a deep-learning backend for trainable components.

EDS-NLP is versatile and can be used on any textual document. The rule-based components are fully compatible with spaCy's components, and vice versa. This library is a product of collaborative effort, and we encourage further contributions to enhance its capabilities.

Check out our interactive [demo](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/demo/) !

## Features

- [Rule-based components](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/pipes/) for French clinical notes
- [Trainable components](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/pipes/trainable): NER, Span classification
- Support for multitask deep-learning models with [weights sharing](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/concepts/torch-component/#sharing-subcomponents)
- [Fast inference](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/concepts/inference/), with multi-GPU support out of the box
- Easy to use, with a spaCy-like API
- Compatible with rule-based spaCy components
- Support for various io formats like [BRAT](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/data/standoff/), [JSON](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/data/json/), [Parquet](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/data/parquet/), [Pandas](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/data/pandas/) or [Spark](https://aphp.github.io/edsnlp/latest/data/spark/)

## Quick start

### Installation

You can install EDS-NLP via `pip`. We recommend pinning the library version in your projects, or use a strict package manager like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```shell
pip install edsnlp==0.10.7
```

or if you want to use the trainable components (using pytorch)

```shell
pip install "edsnlp[ml]==0.10.7"
```

### A first pipeline

Once you've installed the library, let's begin with a very simple example that extracts mentions of COVID19 in a text, and detects whether they are negated.

```python
import edsnlp

nlp = edsnlp.blank("eds")

terms = dict(
    covid=["covid", "coronavirus"],
)

# Split the documents into sentences, this isneeded for negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.sentences")
# Matcher component
nlp.add_pipe("eds.matcher", config=dict(terms=terms))
# Negation detection
nlp.add_pipe("eds.negation")

# Process your text in one call !
doc = nlp("Le patient n'est pas atteint de covid")

doc.ents
# Out: (covid,)

doc.ents[0]._.negation
# Out: True
```

## Disclaimer

The performances of an extraction pipeline may depend on the population and documents that are considered.
