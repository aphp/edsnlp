# Contributing to EDS-NLP

We welcome contributions ! There are many ways to help. For example, you can:

1. Help us track bugs by filing issues
2. Suggest and help prioritise new functionalities
3. Develop a new pipeline ! Fork the project and propose a new functionality through a pull request
4. Help us make the library as straightforward as possible, by simply asking questions on whatever does not seem clear to you.

## Development installation

To be able to run the test suite, run the example notebooks and develop your own pipeline, you should clone the repo and install it locally.

<div class="termy">

```console
# Clone the repository and change directory
$ git clone https://github.com/aphp/edsnlp.git
---> 100%
$ cd edsnlp

# Optional: create a virtual environment
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

# Install setup dependencies and build resources
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements-setup.txt
$ python scripts/conjugate_verbs.py

# Install development dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt

# Finally, install the package
$ pip install .
```

</div>

To make sure the pipeline will not fail because of formatting errors, we added pre-commit hooks using the `pre-commit` Python library. To use it, simply install it:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pre-commit install
```

</div>

The pre-commit hooks defined in the [configuration](https://gitlab.eds.aphp.fr/datasciencetools/edsnlp/-/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml) will automatically run when you commit your changes, letting you know if something went wrong.

The hooks only run on staged changes. To force-run it on all files, run:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pre-commit run --all-files
---> 100%
All good !
```

</div>

## Proposing a merge request

At the very least, your changes should :

- Be well-documented ;
- Pass every tests, and preferably implement its own ;
- Follow the style guide.

### Testing your code

We use the Pytest test suite.

The following command will run the test suite. Writing your own tests is encouraged !

```shell
python -m pytest
```

Should your contribution propose a bug fix, we require the bug be thoroughly tested.

### Architecture of a pipeline

All pipelines should follow the same pattern :

```
edsnlp/pipelines/<pipeline>
   |-- <pipeline>.py                # Defines the component logic
   |-- patterns.py                  # Defines matched patterns
   |-- factory.py                   # Declares the pipeline to spaCy
```

### Style Guide

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to reformat the code. While other formatter only enforce PEP8 compliance, Black also makes the code uniform. In short :

> Black reformats entire files in place. It is not configurable.

Moreover, the CI/CD pipeline enforces a number of checks on the "quality" of the code. To wit, non black-formatted code will make the test pipeline fail. We use `pre-commit` to keep our codebase clean.

Refer to the [development install tutorial](#development-installation) for tips on how to format your files automatically.
Most modern editors propose extensions that will format files on save.

### Documentation

Make sure to document your improvements, both within the code with comprehensive docstrings,
as well as in the documentation itself if need be.

We use `MkDocs` for EDS-NLP's documentation. You can checkout the changes you make with:

<div class="termy">

```console
# Install the requirements
$ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
---> 100%
Installation successful
A
# Run the documentation
$ mkdocs serve
```

</div>

Go to [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) to see your changes. MkDocs watches for changes in the documentation folder
and automatically reloads the page.
